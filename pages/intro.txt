This guide is meant to help you learn about Jailbreaking an iOS or iPadOS device, why you should do it, and how to do it safely.

I recommend bookmarking this page if you intend to jailbreak.

If this is the device that you intend to jailbreak, please bookmark this site before you begin, or use another device. Your phone will restart during the process.

If you are ready to start, slide to jailbreak below.
