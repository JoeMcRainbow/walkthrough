<p>Jailbreaking does have some caveats, that may make you reconsider the decision to jailbreak. These could be any of the following:</p>
<ol class="left">
    <li>Blocked access to certain apps (usually Banking apps, as well as some games, like Pok√®mon GO).</li>
    <li>Security of your device is vulnerable (same as a normal computer at this point).</li>
    <li>If you accidentally break your phone or corrupt your software, Apple may refuse service.</li>
    <li>Jailbreaking voids your warranty with Apple.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you can accept these terms, please feel free to continue.</p>
