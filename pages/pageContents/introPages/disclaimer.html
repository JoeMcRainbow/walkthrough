<p>Jailbreaking your device is done at your own risk</p>
<p>I cannot and will not be held accountable for any errors that arise from your operation of your device, the jailbrekaing process, or any other methods mentioned henceforth.</p>
<p>While I certainly hope that nothing ever goes wrong, (expletive) happens.</p>
<p>In the event that something does go wrong, retrace your steps to determine what you did wrong, or feel free to reach out to the greater community on <a href="https://reddit.com/r/jailbreak">r/Jailbreak</a> or on the <a href="https://discord.gg/jb">r/Jailbreak Discord Server</a></p>
<p>By continuing to jailbreak, you agree to hold me harmless if something goes wrong at any point.</p>
