PAGES FOR DEVICES, BY CHIPSET:

    Pages for A-series chips numbered by chip (A15 => page 15).
    Pages for M-series chips numbered in negative numerical order 
        by chronological release order (M1 => page -1, M1 Pro/Max
        => page -2).

    Home page is page 1

    Legacy devices is page 0

JAILBREAKS:

    Jailbreaks will be paged as iOS Version, with the jailbreak 
        type appended in numerical order. If there are multiple
        jailbreaks of that type, they will be listed below with
        another number to be appended to the jailbreak page number.

    TYPES OF JAILBREAKS - NUMBERS:
        1 - Tethered
        2 - Semi-Tethered
        3 - Semi-Untethered
        4 - Untethered
        5 - Rootless

    DUPLICATE JAILBREAK PAGES - NUMBERS:
        1431: unc0ver for iOS 14
        1432: Taurine for iOS 14
        1331: unc0ver for iOS 13
        1332: Odyssey for iOS 13

    For example, an iOS 14 jailbreak page for devices with a
        Semi-Untethered jailbreak would be page 143, as it's iOS 14, 
        with jailbreak type 3 appended to the iOS version. If the user
        wanted to jailbreak with Taurine, they would append 2 to this 
        page, thus the final page number would be 1432. 
        loadJB(1432); would be used.
    
    Pages like 14.5.12 are NOT correct, as iOS versions are only 
    listed by base version (15.x, 14.x, etc => 15, 14, etc).
